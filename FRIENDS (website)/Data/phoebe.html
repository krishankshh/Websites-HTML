She was born on February 16 and is the daughter of Frank Buffay and Lily Buffay. Her birth-mother's name was Phoebe Abbott. She has a twin sister named Ursula Buffay, who is also portrayed by Kudrow. Phoebe can speak several languages, including French and Italian. She appeared in each of the show's 236 episodes, from its premiere on September 24, 1994 to its finale on May 6, 2004. She is a masseuse and musician, notable for her offbeat and extremely ditzy behavior. She was Monica Geller's roommate before Rachel Green, which is how she was introduced to the group. Phoebe is best friends with Monica and Rachel, along with their neighbors, Chandler Bing and Joey Tribbiani, and also Monica's brother Ross Geller. She plays a Gibson Gospel and sings at Central Perk. During the show's ninth season, Phoebe and Joey decide to choose a blind date for each other. Phoebe finds someone for him, but Joey forgets about their deal and doesn't find anyone for her. So a couple of minutes before the date, Joey accidentally finds Mike who agrees to go on a blind date with Phoebe. Mike Hannigan (played by actor Paul Rudd) and Phoebe begin a romantic relationship. The two later get engaged, then married.</h3>
